## 🤔 2. The Problem
**Analyse and forecast product prices from Retailz competitors.**
Build an API which allows to predict the selling price of two key competitors at a user-defined target date.
The performance of this forecast should be leveled across several product categories.

### 2.2. Context
Competitor pricing can be influenced by multiple factors such as seasonality, customer demand, and promotional strategies.
Some things to consider/look at:
* the average discount per competitor across different product categories
* the level of promotional participation
* how pricing competitiveness varies in time
* knowing which competitor tends to be the cheapest or most expensive in different product categories
* explore whether there is a reactive pricing behavior between competitors – i.e., whether price changes from one player are followed by price adjustments from another
